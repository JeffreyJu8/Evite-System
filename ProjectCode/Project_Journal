Tuesday 4/26/2022: OVerview: I started coding the project. I decided to make an Evite website. I received feedback from peer review for my UML diagram and incorporated the changes
		I created the classes according to my UML diagram
		I started thinking about what how different classes interact with each other and how to code it
		
		
		(120 minutes Coding Session):
		I created all 10 classes for the website
			This includes the two inheritance hierarchies
			3 enums 
			1 interface
		I copied the UI, UIConsole, and Helper classes from previous assignments and made them into a package in this project
		I also made the basic methods for all 10 classes.
		At this point, I have finished setting up my classes and I am ready for the next step. 
		
		
	For Next Time: Start working on the Menu and making it run
		Think about how to code each option of the menu
		Use the login, logout, and password codes we used for class
		Start coding the User classes as well
******************************************************************************************************************************
		
		

Thursday 4/28/2022: I started creating my SampleProgram class.
		I established the menu options from Menu enum with a switch statement
		I also created most of the methods for each option in the menu
		
		(90 minutes Coding Session):
		I created the menu for the website. Now I can run the program
		I also created another class to read user file and methods that can retrieve and save user file
		I took a lot of codes from lecture for the login and logout methods. 
		I also took some code for retrieving and saving user data
		
		
	For Next Time: I need to start working on the PartyType enum.
		I think I need to create another switch statement for the PartyType enum
		Need to find a way for users to chose what kind of parties they would like to make
******************************************************************************************************************************



Monday 5/2/2022: I worked more on my SampleProgram. Now my code runs
		I started writing a file that can read the existing party Evites that the user created
		I also created a menu that allows users to make party evites
		
		(90 minutes coding session)
		I made a main method, which allows my code to run now
		I checked out the basic options for the menu. Although there are many errors, users can login now
		I started working on the option which allows user to read through their existing files.
		
	
	For Next Time: I need to finish the existingEvite() method
		I want to finish making the method that allows users to read their existing files
		I also want to fix my current errors
******************************************************************************************************************************
		
		

Tuesday 5/3/2022: I furnished my SampleProgram and made a file that can save user data
		I finished the code that saves user data, now everytime someone makes an account, their data will be saved
		I also started creating a map that maps user to parties
		
		(90 minute coding session)
		Other than saving user data, my code now also asks users for their party info when they are making an Evite
		I also modified my LoadUserData so that the parseData method now works
		I think at this point, I have finished my LoadUserData class
		
		
	For Next Time: I want to finish my PremUser and NormUser Class
		I want to make sure that they are different enough
		I also have to find a way to create a file that saves user's Evites
******************************************************************************************************************************



Thursday 5/5/2022: I found a way to save user's Evites
		I wrote the code on how to save user's Evites
		I utilized what we did in lecture to help me accomplish this
		
		(120 minute coding session)
		I figured out how to save user's Evites to a file, which is an important aspect of this project
		I also updated my NormEvite and PremEvite
		I also made changes to my NormUser and PremUser
		
	For Next Time: Finish saving Evite to a file
		I am going to finish the method that saves user's Evite to a file
		I am also going to start working on the guest list
******************************************************************************************************************************



Friday 5/6/2022: I finished the Envelope and Evite file
		I finished the code that helps the users make Envelope 
		I also finished making the Evite file
		
		(120 minute coding session)
		I have created a file that saves user's Evite 
		I also used a switch statement for the Envelope enum and the users can now make Envelopes
		
	For Next Time: Finish guest list and make sure my code runs!
		The last thing I need to do is to finish my guest list
		I also need to make sure my code runs
******************************************************************************************************************************



Saturday 5/7/2022: I finished the project!
		I wrote the guest list code 
		My program also runs fully now
		
		(5 hour coding session)
		My program now allows users to make a guest list and it stores it in the Evite file
		The program also now runs fully which means I have completed the project!
